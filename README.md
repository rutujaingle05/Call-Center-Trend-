Call Center Trend Analyisis
1.DataBackground and Overview
This dashboard was developed as part of a virtual internship simulation by PwC through Forage. The task was to create a comprehensive analytical report on Call Center Trends using realistic datasets. The goal was to help stakeholders assess call performance, agent productivity, and customer satisfaction over time.

2.Data Structure and Overview
The project involved two main datasets:
•	Call Dataset:
o	Date of Call
o	Topic (Streaming, Payment, Technical Support, Admin, Contract)
o	Duration & Resolution Time
o	Satisfaction Ratings (Scale 1–5)
•	Agent Dataset:
o	Agent Name
o	Number of Calls Answered
o	Time Spent per Call
o	Customer Feedback & Performance Metrics
The data was loaded into Power BI, cleansed, modeled, and visualized using appropriate charts and KPIs.

•	Use dashboards to track peaks and adapt staffing accordingly.
✔️ Time Optimization:
•	Deep-dive into why streaming and payment-related calls take longer.
✔️ Feedback Loop:
•	Collect post-call feedback to better understand drop in satisfaction over time.
